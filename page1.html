    Ice cream is a beloved frozen dessert enjoyed worldwide, typically made from a mixture of milk, cream, sugar, and flavorings, with air incorporated during the freezing process to create its characteristic smooth, semi-solid texture. To be classified as standard "ice cream" in the U.S., a product must contain at least 10% milk fat. The dessert has a rich history, with ancient civilizations enjoying early forms made from snow and ice mixed with honey and fruit juices. It evolved over centuries through various cultures, eventually becoming a mass-produced, globally accessible treat after the advent of industrial refrigeration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
