    Ice cream is a beloved frozen dessert enjoyed worldwide, typically made from a mixture of milk, cream, sugar, and flavorings, with air incorporated during the freezing process to create its characteristic smooth, semi-solid texture. To be classified as standard "ice cream" in the U.S., a product must contain at least 10% milk fat. The dessert has a rich history, with ancient civilizations enjoying early forms made from snow and ice mixed with honey and fruit juices. It evolved over centuries through various cultures, eventually becoming a mass-produced, globally accessible treat after the advent of industrial refrigeration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

  Ice cream's origins trace back to ancient times, with early versions involving snow and ice flavored with honey and fruit juices enjoyed by figures like Alexander the Great and Roman Emperor Nero. The modern, creamy ice cream we know today evolved over centuries, with significant developments in Italy and France, where chefs began incorporating milk, cream, and eggs. A major technological breakthrough involved using salt mixed with ice to create a lower, more controllable freezing temperature, a method known in the Arab world by the 13th century.

  In the United States, ice cream was enjoyed by the elite, including Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, before mass production began. The first large-scale commercial ice cream plant was established in Baltimore in 1851 by Jacob Fussell, making it more accessible to the general public. The ice cream cone was popularized at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair when a vendor ran out of bowls and partnered with a nearby waffle maker.

  Today, ice cream remains a global favorite. The United States produces the most ice cream in the world by volume, and New Zealand boasts the highest per capita consumption. The most popular flavor globally is vanilla, followed by chocolate. The temporary headache known as "brain freeze" is caused by cold ice cream touching the roof of the mouth, which causes blood vessels in the head to dilate suddenly. An average scoop of ice cream is typically finished in about 50 licks.
